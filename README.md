## Extra Account Security (MFA)
We suggest everyone turn on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for any accounts that have dangerous permissions on social platforms. This extra step helps keep your accounts safe and sound.
*MFA adds a layer of security by asking for extra verification beyond just a password. It helps keep sensitive info secure and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.*

## Voluntary Participation
As of April 2024, We can't offer payment to team members.
*Everyone here is a volunteer, so please don't expect to get paid.*

## Keeping Things Private
Please don't share any internal info or links with anyone outside the team without permission.
*Keeping things confidential is super important to protect our sensitive info. By following this, you're helping keep our team's privacy and security intact.*

## Honesty is Important
If anyone gives false information in their application, they won't be able to stay on the team. Honesty and integrity are really important to us.

## Stay Active and Involved
We encourage everyone to stay involved and contribute to the team as much as they can, according to their role and availability.
*This means it's important to actively participate and help out the team, to make sure our project is a success! :D*

## Positions Limitation
To apply for a specific position, you must fill out the application form during the designated period. Even if you're already part of the team, we can't assign you a role just because you requested it.
*This ensures that all applicants are evaluated equally and fairly when positions become available, promoting fairness and equal opportunity for all members.*

## Role Permissions
Team members have the permissions associated with their own role as well as all roles below theirs.
