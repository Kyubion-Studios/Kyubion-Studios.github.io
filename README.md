## Groups
Put these styles in those groups. The groups also need to be in the following sequence:
- Styles
  > For colors, images, background...
- Behaviour
  > animations, overflow, pointers...
- Media Query
  > the layouts for different screen sizes
  - Layout
    > For margin, padding, flexboxes, grids etc
  - Blocks
    > For sizes, positions, font-sizes, font-weight, text-align, line-height etc
    
## Styles
- always set the color to the specific element
- only set padding from the elements, never from a div/section to another
- do not specify elements by parents/childs, always create an UUID for an element
